# OPM (Offline Python Mentor)

OPM is a serverless implementation of Online Python Tutor Lite (OPTLite) designed for offline use and enhanced educational environments. This project builds upon the [optlite](https://github.com/dive4dec/optlite) concept while making it more accessible and secure for educational settings. Integrated with [WEBLLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm) for advanced language model capabilities.

## Features

- **Serverless Operation**: Runs entirely in the browser using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org)
- **Offline Capability**: Can be used without internet connection
- **Enhanced Security**: No server-side code execution, reducing security risks
- **Educational Focus**: Perfect for classroom settings and online exams
- **Safe Exam Browser Compatible**: Works with [Safe Exam Browser](https://safeexambrowser.org/) 
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è The AI model does not work with Safe Exam Browser at present.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visual representation of Python program execution
- **Live Editing Mode**: Real-time code editing and visualization
- **Socratic AI hints**: Provide Socratic style hints instead of answers with the refined LLM model.

## Installation (Github Action)
The pages are automaticly compiled with github action, and pushed to the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/dive4dec/OPT_Mentor/tree/gh-pages) branch. Those compiled files will work with a web server.

## Installation (for local host)
1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your system
2. Run the command in cmd or terminal
   ```docker-compose up -d --build```
3. The script will:
   - Build the Docker image of optlite-webllm and AI-model
   - RUN the docker container

## Project Structure

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AI-Model                 # AI model component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JupyterLite              # The JupyterLite component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ optlite-webllm           # the integraded optlite and webllm
```

## Usage
Run the container with:
```bash

```

Access at http://localhost:8000

for stop the service
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Development
The project consists of several key components:
- **OPT Lite**: The core visualization engine
- **JupyterLite Integration**: For notebook-based interactions
- **WebLLM Integration**: For serverless AI assistant
- **Pyodide Runtime**: For in-browser Python execution
- **[optmwidgets](https://github.com/chiwangso2/optmwidgets)**: A widget built on top of [divewidgets](https://github.com/dive4dec/divewidgets) that provide programming ai assistant using webllm and langchain.

## Requirements
- Docker

## Acknowledgments

- Based on [optlite](https://github.com/dive4dec/optlite)
- Uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) for in-browser Python execution
- Integrates with [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/) for notebook functionality
